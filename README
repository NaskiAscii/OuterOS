An operating system by two idiots who don't know what they are doing.

1. How to build it:

If it's not on actions:

Make the docker container:

docker build buildenv -t myos-buildenv

Run the docker container:

Linux or MacOS: docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/root/env myos-buildenv
Windows (CMD): docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/root/env myos-buildenv
Windows (PowerShell): docker run --rm -it -v "${pwd}:/root/env" myos-buildenv

Make the thingy:

make build-x86_64
exit

Test the OS:

qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso
